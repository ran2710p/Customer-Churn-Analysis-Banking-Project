Here my Project on-Customer Churn Analysis for Banking domain

Goal: 

Analysis will assist Bank to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.



Project Overview: 

The dataset consisted of raw CSV & excel workbooks. The primary objective of this project was to gain deep insights into customer exit and churn% spanning the years 2016 to 2019. Using Power BI, I embarked on a journey to analyse key metrics based on customer credit score, uncover opportunities for growth and to develop loyalty programs
